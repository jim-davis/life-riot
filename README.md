life-riot
=========

Client-side implementation of Conway's game of Life.  Uses riot.js for management

## Installation

Installation is slightly cumbersome because I don't want to bundle riot in this repo, so instead you need to use npm and bower to fetch riot.

First, install nodejs (and npm)

`npm install -g bower`

``` sh
bower install
npm install
./make.js gen
```
